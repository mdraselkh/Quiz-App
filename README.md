I worked on it by javascript and concentrate with this language and helped by another language html and css. There are four questions and each questions has four options to decide which option is correct
and if the clicked option is corrected then the full division of this option color will be grenish otherwise redish color. And after answering four question , i made a score board for it where 
shows how many answers are right.
